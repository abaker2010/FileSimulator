# FileSimulator

Built with Python 3.7.3
-----------------------

Overview
-----------------------

	This is a small python that was built for the purpose of emulating an IoT usage.

	Since IoT devices are used for a single task, to further data collection of standard 
	system performance I needed to come up with a tool that could simulate a usage, this 
	simulates a user talking to a file server or another device running on http traffic

Usage
-----------------------

	python3.7 FileEmulator.py


TODO
-----------------------
	
	Add options for command-line to
		- Specify IP
		- Specify Port
		- Specify File for the page
